# AD5248

Arduino library for I2C digital potentioMeter AD5243 + rheostat AD5248


## Description

The AD5243 is a digital potentiometer, the AD5248 is a digital rheostat.


|  device  |  channels  |  steps |  ranges KÎ©         |  notes  :|
|:--------:|:----------:|:------:|:------------------:|:--------:|
|  AD5243  |     2      |  256   |  2.5, 10, 50, 100  |  potentioMeter
|  AD5248  |     2      |  256   |  2.5, 10, 50, 100  |  rheostat


Both IC's have two "channels" and they do not have the output lines
some other IC's in these series have e.g. like the AD5242.

The AD5243 has a fixed address (0x2F = 47) while the AD5248 has 2 address pins 
giving 4 possible addresses. See table.


| Addr(dec)| Addr(Hex) |  AD1  |  AD0  |
|:--------:|:---------:|:-----:|:-----:|
|    44    |   0x2C    |  GND  |  GND  |
|    45    |   0x2D    |  GND  |  +5V  |
|    46    |   0x2E    |  +5V  |  GND  |
|    47    |   0x2F    |  +5V  |  +5V  |


An important property of the devices is that they defaults
to their mid position at startup.

The library defines AD5243_MIDPOINT == 127.
To be used to set to defined mid-point.

#### Compatibles


If you know compatible devices please let me know.


## Interface

```cpp
#include "AD5248.h"
```

The library has a number of functions which are all quite straightforward.
One can get / set the value of (both) the potentiometer(s), and the O1 and O2 output lines.


#### Constructors

- **AD5243(TwoWire \*wire = &Wire)** constructor base class,
creates an instance with 2 potentiometers.
- **AD5248(uint8_t address, TwoWire \*wire = &Wire)** create an instance with 2 rheostats.
- **bool begin()** initialization of the object. 
Note the user must call **wire.begin()** or equivalent before calling **begin()**.
- **bool isConnected()** See if the address set in constructor is on the I2C bus.


#### REad write

- **uint8_t read(uint8_t channel)** read back the set value.
- **uint8_t write(uint8_t channel, uint8_t value)** set channel 0/1 to value 0..255.
- **uint8_t zeroAll()** sets all potentiometer's to 0 and I/O to LOW.
- **uint8_t reset()** sets all potentiometer's to midpoint == 127. (startup default)
- **uint8_t midScaleReset(uint8_t channel)** resets one potentiometer to midpoint == 127.
- **uint8_t readBackRegister()** read register back, for debugging.


#### Experimental

- **uint8_t shutDown()** check datasheet, not tested yet, use at own risk.


## Operation

The examples show the basic working of the functions.


## Error codes

|  define        |  value  |
|:---------------|:-------:|
|  AD5248_OK     |   0     |
|  AD5248_ERROR  |   100   |


## Future

#### Must

- improve documentation.
- buy hardware
- test

#### Should

- sync with AD524X library.

#### Could


#### Wont
